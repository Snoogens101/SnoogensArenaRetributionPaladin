# Snoogens Arena Retribution Paladin   
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/5rOW5we.png)  

A PVP only rotation with a specific focus on Arena, however with full support for Battleground usage.  
Supports any level.  
Only compatible with English Language World of Warcraft Client. This means that this rotation won't work for WoW clients with German, Russian etc languages.  
Purchase a license through https://shoppy.gg/@snoogens  
Discord: https://discord.gg/VksJWWk9PS  
Unzip and place the `Snoogens-Arena-Windwalker-Monk` folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. `X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations`  
Place the `license.txt` file you've recieved by email after purchasing in the `Snoogens-Arena-Windwalker-Monk` folder.  

I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.
