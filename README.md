A PVP only rotation with a specific focus on Arena, however with full support for Battleground usage.  
Only compatible with English Language World of Warcraft Client. This means that this rotation won't work for WoW clients with German, Russian etc languages.

Unzip and place the `Snoogens-Arena-Retribution-Paladin` folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. `X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations`  
Place the `license.txt` file you've recieved by email after purchasing in the `Snoogens-Arena-Retribution-Paladin` folder.  

I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.
